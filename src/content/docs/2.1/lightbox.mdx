import Ec from 'snippets/ec.astro';


import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

The Lightbox component is fully responsive and supports touch and swipe navigation, as well as mouse drag for desktops. When swiping between slides the animation literally sticks at your fingertip or mouse cursor. Clicking fast on the previous and next navigation, will make animations even accelerate to keep up with your pace. All animations are hardware accelerated for a smoother performance.

## Usage

To apply this component, add the `data-uk-lightbox` attribute to a container to turn all anchors inside that container into lightbox links.

<Ec path="lightbox.1" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.basic" />

## Alt Attribute

To add an `alt` attribute to the image in the lightbox, set the `data-alt` attribute on an anchor.

<Ec path="lightbox.2" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.alt_attribute" />

## Caption

To display a caption at the bottom of the lightbox, set the `data-caption` attribute on an anchor.

<Ec path="lightbox.3" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.caption" />

## Animations

By default, the Lightbox gallery uses a slide animation. You can set the `animation` option to use a different one. Possible values are `slide`, `fade` and `scale`.

<Ec path="lightbox.4" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.animations" />

## Navigations

By default, the lightbox shows a slidenav from the [Slidenav component](/docs/2.1/slidenav). To hide the slidenav, set the `slidenav: false` option. To show an item-based navigation, for example, from the [Thumbnav component](/docs/2.1/thumbnav) or [Dotnav component](/docs/2.1/dotnav), set the `nav` option to `thumbnav` or `dotnav`.

<Ec path="lightbox.5" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.navigations" />

## Counter

To show a counter with the current item number and the total number of items, add the `counter: true` option.

<Snippet component="lightbox.counter" />

## Content sources

A lightbox is not restricted to images. Other media, like videos, can be displayed as well. The video will pause whenever it's not visible and resume once it becomes visible again. To display a poster image for a video, set the `data-poster` attribute.

<Ec path="lightbox.6" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.content_sources" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> Use `youtube-nocookie.com`
within the YouTube link and the lightbox will use the domain to embed the
YouTube video.

### Manual content type

The Lightbox uses the `href` attribute to figure out the type of the linked content. If no filename extension is defined in the path, just add the `data-type` attribute to the `<a>` tag.

**Hint** YouTube and Vimeo Urls will be handled automatically.

| Option               | Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `data-type="image"`  | The content type is an image.          |
| `data-type="video"`  | The content type is a video.           |
| `data-type="iframe"` | The content type is a regular website. |

## Delay controls

By default, the controls are hidden after a short time if the mouse doesn't move. Set the `delay-controls: 0` option to always show the controls.

<Ec path="lightbox.7" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.delay_controls" />

## BG close

By default, the lightbox closes if the background is clicked. To prevent this behavior, set the `bg-close: false` option.

<Ec path="lightbox.8" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.bg_close" />

## Custom Attributes

You can add custom attributes to lightbox content items by using the `data-attrs` attribute. The attributes are passed like the usual component options, e.g. `data-attrs="width: 1280; height: 720;"`

<Ec path="lightbox.9" />

<Snippet component="lightbox.custom_attributes" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)

## Accessibility

The Lightbox component adheres to the [Dialog (Modal) WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/) and the [Carousel WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/) and automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties.

- The _lightbox_ has the `dialog` role, the `aria-modal` property and the `aria-roledescription` property set to `carousel`.
- The _slide list_ has an ID, the `presentation` role and the `aria-live` property.
- The _slides_ have an ID, the `group` role, the `aria-roledescription` property set to `slide` and an `aria-label` property.

The previous/next navigation adheres to the [button pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/).

- The _prev/next navigation items_ have the `button` role, the `aria-controls` property set to the ID of the slide list, and an `aria-label` property.

The Close component automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles and properties.

- The _close icon_ has the `aria-label` property, and if an `<a>` element is used, the `button` role.

### Keyboard interaction

The lightbox gallery can be accessed through the keyboard using the following keys.

- The <kbd>left/right arrow</kbd> keys navigate through the slides. If the focus is on the last slide, it moves to the first slide.
- The <kbd>home</kbd> or <kbd>end</kbd> keys move the focus to the first or last slide.
- The <kbd>esc</kbd> key closes the lightbox.

### Internationalization

The Lightbox component uses the following translation strings. Learn more about [translating components](/docs/2.1/accessibility#internationalization).

| Key          | Default          | Description                             |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `next`       | `Next Slide`     | `aria-label` for next slide button.     |
| `previous`   | `Previous Slide` | `aria-label` for previous slide button. |
| `slideLabel` | `%s of %s`       | `aria-label` for slide.                 |
| `close`      | `Close`          | `aria-label` for close button.          |
