## Usage

To have an image cover its parent element, add the `.uk-cover-container` class to the parent and the `data-uk-cover` attribute to the image.

<Ec path="cover.1" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> To position content on top
of the covering element, use the [Position component](/docs/2.1/position).

<Snippet component="cover.basic" />

## Video

To create a video that covers its parent container, add the `data-uk-cover` attribute to a video. Wrap a container element around the video and add the `.uk-cover-container` class to clip the content.

The Cover component inherits all properties from the [Video component](/docs/2.1/video) which means videos are muted and play automatically. The video will pause whenever it's not visible and resume once it becomes visible again.

<Ec path="cover.2" />

<Snippet component="cover.video" />

## Iframe

To apply the Cover component to an iframe, you need to add the `data-uk-cover` attribute to the iframe. Now add the `.uk-cover-container` class to a container element around the iframe to clip the content.

<Ec path="cover.3" />

<Snippet component="cover.iframe" />

## Responsive height

To add responsive behavior to your cover image, you need to create an invisible `<canvas>` element and assign `width` and `height` values to it, according to the aspect ratio you want the covered area to have. That way it will adapt the responsive behavior of the image.

<Ec path="cover.4" />

<Snippet component="cover.responsive_height" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)
