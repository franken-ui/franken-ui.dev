## Usage

Add one of the following classes to form controls inside a `<form>` element to define them.

| Class               | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-input`         | Add this class to `<input>` elements.                                           |
| `.uk-select`        | Add this class to `<select>` elements.                                          |
| `.uk-textarea`      | Add this class to `<textarea>` elements.                                        |
| `.uk-radio`         | Add this class to `<input type="radio">` elements to create radio buttons.      |
| `.uk-checkbox`      | Add this class to `<input type="checkbox">` elements to create checkboxes.      |
| `.uk-range`         | Add this class to `<input type="range">` elements to create range forms.        |
| `.uk-toggle-switch` | Add this class to `<input type="checkbox">` elements to create toggle switches. |

<Ec path="form.1" />

Add the `.uk-fieldset` class to a `<fieldset>` element and the `.uk-legend` class to a `<legend>` element to define a fieldset and a form legend.

<Snippet component="form.basic" />

## Destructive modifier

Add the `.uk-form-destructive` class to an `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>` element to notify the user that the value is not validated.

<Snippet component="form.danger" />

## Size modifiers

There are several size modifiers available. Just add one of the following classes to make the form smaller or larger.

| Class         | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `.uk-form-xs` | Applies extra small size. |
| `.uk-form-sm` | Applies small size.       |
| `.uk-form-md` | Applies medium size.      |
| `.uk-form-lg` | Applies large size.       |

<Snippet component="form.size" />

## Width modifiers

You can use Tailwind CSS utility classes alongside form classes and the it will follow its width.

<Snippet component="form.width" />

## Blank modifier

Add the `.uk-form-blank` class to minimize the styling of form controls.

<Snippet component="form.blank" />

## Layout

Define labels and controls and apply a stacked or horizontal layout to form elements. Layout modifiers can be added to any parent element like the `<fieldset>` element. This makes it possible to have different form layouts for each fieldset.

| Class                     | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-form-stacked`        | Add this class to display labels on top of controls.            |
| `.uk-form-horizontal`     | Add this class to display labels and controls side by side.     |
| `.uk-form-label`          | Add this class to define form labels.                           |
| `.uk-form-label-required` | Add this class to automatically add an asterisk to form labels. |
| `.uk-form-controls`       | Add this class to define form controls.                         |

<Ec path="form.2" />

<Snippet component="form.layout" />

### Horizontal form

Use the `.uk-form-controls-text` class to better align checkboxes and radio buttons when using them with text in a horizontal layout.

<Ec path="form.3" />

<Snippet component="form.horizontal" />

## Form and icons

You use an icon from the [Icon component](/docs/2.1/icon) inside a form. Add the `.uk-form-icon` class to a `<span>` element. Group it with an `<input>` element by adding the `.uk-inline` class to a container element around both. The icon has to come first in the markup. By default, the icon will be placed on the left side of the form. To change the alignment, add the `.uk-form-icon-flip` class.

<Ec path="form.4" />

<Snippet component="form.icon" />

### Clickable icons

To enable an action, for example opening a modal to pick an image or link, use an `<a>` or `<button>` element to create the icon.

<Ec path="form.5" />

<Snippet component="form.clickable_icon" />

## Custom controls

To replace a file input or select forms with your own HTML content, like a button or text, add the `data-uk-form-custom` attribute to a container element.

### File

Use a button or text as a file input.

<Ec path="form.6" />

<Snippet component="form.custom_controls_file" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> The hover and focus state
for `uk-form-custom` are not styled by default, but you could use the adjacent
sibling selector to do so.

### Select

Use a button, text or a link as a select form. Just add the `target: SELECTOR` option to the `uk-form-custom` attribute to select where the option value should be displayed. `target: true` will select the adjacent element in the markup.

<Ec path="form.7" />

<Snippet component="form.custom_controls_select" />

## Help block

Form text can be created using `.uk-form-help` and should be explicitly associated with the form control it relates to using the `aria-describedby` attribute. This will ensure that assistive technologies—such as screen readers—will announce this form text when the user focuses or enters the control.

<Snippet component="form.help_block" />

## Toggle Switch

Use the following toggle switch component to ask for a yes or no type of input from your users without the use of JavaScript. You can also add the the `.uk-toggle-switch-destructive` modifier to apply a destructive style.

<Snippet component="form.toggle_switch" />

## Accessibility

Set the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties to the Form component.

- If no `<label>` element is associated with the form control, set the `aria-label` property to the form control to describe its meaning.

<Ec path="form.8" />
