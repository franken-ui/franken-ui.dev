## Usage

The Switcher component consists of a number of toggles and their related content items. Add the `data-uk-switcher` attribute to a list element which contains the toggles. Add the `.uk-switcher` class to the element containing the content items.

By default, the element with the `.uk-switcher` class has to succeed the toggle directly in order for the switcher to function. If you need it to be nested in another element, for example when using a grid, add the `connect: SELECTOR` option to the `data-uk-switcher` attribute and select the element containing the items for switching.

Typically, the switcher toggles are styled through other components, some of which will be shown here.

<Ec path="switcher.1" />

In this example we are using the [Subnav component](/docs/2.1/subnav).

<Snippet component="switcher.basic" />

## Navigation controls

In some cases you want to switch to another content section from within the active content. This is possible using the `data-uk-switcher-item` attribute. To target the items, you need to set the attribute to the number of the respective content item.

Setting the attribute to `next` and `previous` will switch to the adjacent items.

<Ec path="switcher.2" />

<Snippet component="switcher.navigation_controls" />

## Connect multiple containers

It is also possible to connect multiple content containers. Just add the `connect` parameter to the `data-uk-switcher` attribute and use a selector that applies to all items.

<Ec path="switcher.3" />

<Snippet component="switcher.multiple_containers" />

## Animations

You can apply all animations from the [Animation component](/docs/2.1/animation) to switcher items. To do so, add the `animation` parameter with the relevant class to the `data-uk-switcher` attribute.

<Ec path="switcher.4" />

<Snippet component="switcher.animations" />

### Multiple animations

You can also apply multiple animations from the [Animation component](/docs/2.1/animation). That way you can add different in and out animations.

<Ec path="switcher.5" />

<Snippet component="switcher.multiple_animations" />

## Switcher and subnav

The switcher is easily applied to the [Subnav component](/docs/2.1/subnav).

<Ec path="switcher.6" />

<Snippet component="switcher.subnav" />

## Switcher and tab

As an exception to the rule, add the `data-uk-tab` attribute instead of `data-uk-switcher` to the tabbed navigation to combine the switcher with the [Tab component](/docs/2.1/tab).

<Ec path="switcher.7" />

<Snippet component="switcher.tab" />

### Vertical tabs

You can use the width and grid utility classes from Tailwind CSS to display content correctly with a vertical tabbed navigation.

<Ec path="switcher.8" />

<Snippet component="switcher.vertical_tabs" />

## Switcher and button

The switcher can also be applied to buttons or button groups from the [Button component](/docs/2.1/button). Just add the switcher attribute to a block around a group of buttons or to the element with the `.uk-btn-group` class.

<Ec path="switcher.9" />

<Snippet component="switcher.button" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> Since this example does not
wrap the buttons into list items the clickable elements which trigger the
content switching has to be changed by using the `toggle` option.

## Switcher and nav

To apply the switcher to the [Nav component](/docs/2.1/nav), add the `data-uk-switcher` attribute to the nav `<ul>` element.

<Ec path="switcher.10" />

<Snippet component="switcher.nav" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)

| Option        | Value        | Default              | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `active `     | Number       | `0`                  | Active index on init. Providing a negative number indicates a position starting from the end of the set. |
| `animation`   | String       | `false`              | Space-separated names of [animations](/docs/2.1/animation). Comma-separated for animation out.               |
| `duration`    | Number       | `200`                | The animation duration.                                                                                  |
| `swiping`     | Boolean      | `true`               | Use swiping.                                                                                             |
| `followFocus` | Boolean      | `false`              | Selection follows focus automatically.                                                                   |

`connect` is the _Primary_ option and its key may be omitted, if it's the only option in the attribute value.

### Initialization

<Ec path="switcher.12" />

### Events

The following events will be triggered on the connected items of the elements with this component attached:

| Name         | Description                                                                                    |

| `hidden`     | Fires after an item is hidden.                                                                 |

### Methods

The following methods are available for the component:

#### Show

<Ec path="switcher.13" />

Shows the Switcher item with given index.

| Name    | Type                 | Default | Description                           |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `index` | String, Number, Node | 0       | Switcher item to show. 0 based index. |

## Accessibility

The Switcher component adheres to the [Tab WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/) and automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties.

- The _toggle navigation_ has the `tablist` role, and if it is a [Nav component](/docs/2.1/nav), the `aria-orientation` state set to `vertical`.
- The _toggle navigation items_ have the `presentation` role.
- The _toggle navigation links_ have an ID, the `tab` role, the `aria-selected` state and the `aria-controls` property set to the ID of the respective content item.
- The _content list_ has the `presentation` role.
- The _content list items_ have the ID, the `tabpanel` role and the `aria-labelledby` property set to the ID of the respective toggle item.

### Keyboard interaction

The toggle navigation can be accessed through keyboard using the following keys.

- The <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> keys place focus on the active toggle in the toggle navigation. If the focus already is on the active toggle, the focus will move to the next element outside the toggle navigation.
- The <kbd>left/right arrow</kbd> or <kbd>up/down arrow</kbd> keys, depending on the orientation, navigate through the toggles. If the focus is on the last toggle, it moves to the first toggle.
- The <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> keys activate the corresponding content item of the focused toggle.
- The <kbd>home</kbd> or <kbd>end</kbd> keys move the focus to the first or last toggle.

By default, the Switcher component has the manual activation behavior. This means the corresponding content items will only be activated using the <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd>keys. To switch to automatic activation, set `follow-focus` to `true`. When navigating through toggle items, the corresponding content item will get active automatically.
