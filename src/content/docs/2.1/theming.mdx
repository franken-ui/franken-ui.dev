Franken UI, just like shadcn/ui use a simple `background` and `foreground` convention for colors. The `background` variable is used for the background color of the component and the `foreground` variable is used for the text color.

The `background` suffix is omitted when the variable is used for the background color of the component.

Given the following CSS variables:

<Ec version="2.1" path="theming.1" />

The `background` color of the following component will be `hsl(var(--primary))` and the `foreground` color will be `hsl(var(--primary-foreground))`.

<Ec path="theming.2" />

**CSS variables must be defined without color space function**. See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables) for more information.

## List of variables

Here's the list of variables available for customization:

## Adding new colors

To add new colors, simply add them to your main CSS file.

<Ec version="2.1" path="theming.22" />

You can now use the `warning` utility class in your components.

<Ec path="theming.16" />

## Custom palette

<CustomPalette />

## Setting the default palette

To set your newly added palette as the default, simply update the script in your `<head>` tag to reference the new theme name, like so:

<Ec version="2.1" path="theming.21" />

## Adding to theme switcher

To register your newly added palette with the [Theme Switcher](/docs/2.1/theme-switcher#custom-palette), please refer to the corresponding documentation or guide for step-by-step instructions on how to integrate it.
