import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

## Usage

To create a navigation with previous and next buttons, just add the `data-uk-slidenav` attribute to `<a>` elements. Add the `previous` or `next` parameter to the attribute to style the nav items as previous or next buttons.

<Ec path="slidenav.1" />

<Snippet component="slidenav.basic" />

## Slidenav container

To display a conjoint slidenav, wrap the slidenav items inside a `<div>` element and add the `.uk-slidenav-container` class, as well as one of the `.uk-position-*` classes.

<Ec path="slidenav.2" />

<Snippet component="slidenav.container" />

## Position as overlay

To position the slidenav on top of an element or the [Slideshow component](/docs/2.1/slideshow) for example, just add one of the `.uk-position-*` classes from the [Position component](/docs/2.1/position). To create a position context on the container, add the `.uk-position-relative` class.

<Ec path="slidenav.3" />

<Snippet component="slidenav.overlay" />
