## Usage

To apply this component, add the `data-uk-parallax` attribute to any element. Use one of the following options to animate the corresponding CSS property.

| Option             | Description                        | Values         | Start Value |

| `blur`             | Animate the blur filter.           | `px`           | `0`         |
| `hue`              | Animate the hue rotation filter.   | `deg`          | `0`         |
| `grayscale`        | Animate the grayscale filter.      | `%`            | `0`         |
| `invert`           | Animate the invert filter.         | `%`            | `0`         |
| `saturate`         | Animate the saturated filter.      | `%`            | `0`         |
| `sepia`            | Animate the sepia filter.          | `%`            | `0`         |
| `stroke`           | Animate strokes within SVG images. |                | `0`         |

You can use `px`, `%`, `vw` and `vh` units for the length values. The pixel unit can be left out. For example, `x: 200` is the same as `x: 200px`. Basic mathematics operands `+` and `-` are also supported.

Set one of the options to create an animation stop. The property is animated from its start value to the defined stop value.


<Ec path="parallax.1" />

<Snippet component="parallax.basic" />

## Start stop

To set a custom start value, create another animation stop by using two values separated by a comma.

<Ec path="parallax.2" />

<Snippet component="parallax.start_stop" />

## Multiple stops

To better control the property animation, you can set intermediate stops along the animation sequence. Just use a comma-separated list of values. The animation will be equally distributed between the stops.

<Ec path="parallax.3" />

<Snippet component="parallax.multiple_stops" />

## Stop positions

Set an optional stop position to specify the percentage along the animation sequence when the stop occurs.

<Ec path="parallax.4" />

<Snippet component="parallax.stop_positions" />

## Nesting

Different parallax animations can easily be nested.

<Ec path="parallax.5" />

<Snippet component="parallax.stop_positions" />

## Target

The animation starts and stops depending on the element position in the viewport. To start and stop the animation based on the viewport visibility of another element, use the `target` option. This can be helpful when using nested animations.

<Ec path="parallax.6" />

<Snippet component="parallax.target" />

## Start and end

To adjust the animation duration, set the `start` and `end` options. The `start` option defines when the animation starts. The default value of `0` means that the target's top border and viewport's bottom border intersect. The `end` option defines when the animation ends. The default value of `0` means that the target's bottom border and the viewport's top border intersect. Values can be set in any dimension unit, namely `vh`, `%` and `px`. The `%` unit relates to the target's height. Both options allow basic mathematics operands, `+` and `-`.

<Ec path="parallax.7" />

<Snippet component="parallax.start_end" />

## Easing

To adjust the easing of the animation, add the `easing` option. `0` transitions at an even speed. A negative value starts off quickly slowing down until complete while a positive value starts off slowly increasing the speed until complete.

<Snippet component="parallax.easing" />

## Colors

The transition from one color to another, for example for borders, backgrounds or text colors. Define colors using `rgb()` definitions, color keywords or hex values.

<Ec path="parallax.8" />

<Snippet component="parallax.colors" />

## Filters

CSS filters are an easy way to add graphical effects to any element on your page. While they are still an experimental feature for [some browsers](https://caniuse.com/filter), you can safely use them as long as your usability does not suffer. Using the Parallax component, you can dynamically change the amount of a filter on your element.

<Ec path="parallax.9" />

<Snippet component="parallax.filters" />

## SVG Strokes

The Parallax component can be used to animate SVG strokes. The effect looks like the SVG strokes are drawn before your eyes. The SVG image has to be injected into the markup as an inline SVG. This can be done manually or by using the [SVG component](/docs/2.1/svg). Since the SVG component injects the SVG after the image element, the `data-uk-parallax` attribute has to be added to a parent element.

<Ec path="parallax.10" />

<Snippet component="parallax.svg_strokes" />

**Note** It's recommended to use percent unit `%`, so you don't have to know the exact length of the strokes.

## SVG Images

The Parallax component can be applied to the elements of inline SVG images, like `rect`, `circle` and `path`.

<Ec path="parallax.11" />

## Responsive

It's recommended to use `vw` or `vh` as length units instead of pixels. The parallax will adapt depending on the viewport.

The parallax can also be applied to certain viewports only. Add the `media` option with one of the possible values. For example, add a number in pixel, e.g. `640`, or a breakpoint, e.g. `@s`, `@m`, `@l` or `@xl`. The parallax will be shown for the specified viewport width and larger.

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)

| `media`  | Boolean, Number, String | `false` | Condition for the active status - a width as integer (e.g. 640) or a breakpoint (e.g. @s, @m, @l, @xl) or any valid media query (e.g. (min-width: 900px)).                                            |
