## Installation

Under the hood, Franken UI uses [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com). Franken UI provides a thin layer of compatibility and serves as a glue between ApexCharts and shadcn/ui so you don't have to configure anything by yourself.

<WizardChart />

## Usage

Once everything is configured, you may now use the `<uk-chart>` markup in your HTML code with one `<script type="application/json"></script>` tag as options reference.

## Browse charts

<Charts version="2.1" />

## Reactivity

By default, the `<uk-chart>` component is not reactive. This is a deliberate design choice, as using [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) can be computationally expensive. As a result, changes to the referenced `<script type="application/json">` tag will not trigger an update.

To enable reactivity, simply add the `reactive` attribute to the `<uk-chart>` component. This will use [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) under the hood to monitor the `<script>` tag for changes.
