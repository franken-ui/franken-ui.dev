## Usage

The Comment component consists of the comment itself, a comment header, including an avatar, a title and meta text, and a comment body.

<Ec path="comment.1" />

## Primary modifier

To style a comment differently, for example to highlight it as the admin's comment, just add the `.uk-comment-primary` class.

<Ec path="comment.2" />

<Snippet component="comment.primary" />

## Lists

Add the `.uk-comment-list` class to a `<ul>` element to create a list of comments. You can nest any number of `<ul>` elements inside a comment list.

<Ec path="comment.3" />

<Snippet component="comment.list" />

## Accessibility

Set the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties to the Comment component.

- Set the `comment` role for each _comment_.

<Ec path="comment.4" />
