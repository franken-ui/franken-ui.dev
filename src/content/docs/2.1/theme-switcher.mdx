## Usage

To implement the Theme Switcher, you'll need to make some modifications to your HTML code to allow users to change their preferences.

**1.** Start by setting a default theme and mode in the `<head>` tag of your HTML by checking the user's preference:

<Ec version="2.1" path="theme_switcher.1" />

This will first check if a user previously set the theme color preference manually using local storage, and as a fallback, it will either set dark or light mode based on the browser's color scheme preference.

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> You can replace
`uk-theme-neutral` with any of the 15 available themes you want as the default.

**2\.** Ensure that your `<body>` tag includes the classes `bg-background` and `text-foreground` to apply the proper background and text colors that automatically adapt to the currently set theme.

<Ec path="theme_switcher.2" />

**3\.** You can now use the `<uk-theme-switcher>` markup in your HTML code with one `<select hidden></select>` tag as items reference and place it however you like.

<Snippet version="2.1" component="theme_switcher.basic" />

## Custom palette

First, ensure that your `vite.config.js` file is configured to include your custom palette. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/2.1/theming#custom-palette).

## Adding or removing themes

To add or remove theme options, simply add or remove `<option>` tags within the `<optgroup data-key="theme" label="Theme">` group. Each theme option should follow the format:

<Ec path="theme_switcher.3" />

Where:

- The `data-hex` specifies the hex code for the theme preview.
- The `value` specifies the class name for the theme.
- The option text specifies the label for the theme.

## Radii

To allow users to customize radii, add an `<optgroup data-key="radii" label="Radii">` group within the `<select hidden>` tag. This group should contain `<option>` tags for each radii option, such as:

<Ec path="theme_switcher.4" />

## Shadows

Similarly, to allow users to customize shadows, add an `<optgroup data-key="shadows" label="Shadows">` group within the `<select hidden>` tag. This group should contain `<option>` tags for each shadow option, such as:

<Ec path="theme_switcher.5" />

## Font

You can also allow users to customize font size, just add an `<optgroup data-key="font" label="Font">` group within the `<select hidden>` tag. This group should contain `<option>` tags for each font option, such as:

<Ec path="theme_switcher.6" />

## Modes

To allow users to switch between light and dark modes, add an `<optgroup data-key="mode" label="Mode">` group within the `<select hidden>` tag. This group should contain `<option>` tags for each mode option, such as:

<Ec path="theme_switcher.8" />

## Charts

To allow users to switch between chart themes, add an `<optgroup data-key="chart" label="Chart">` group within the `<select hidden>` tag. This group should contain `<option>` tags for each chart theme option, such as:

<Ec version="2.1" path="theme_switcher.9" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> The values inside the `<option>` tags will be attached to the `<head>` tag, allowing for customization. However, the dark and light classes are exceptions and will be handled differently.

## Dropdown

You can use the [Drop](/docs/2.1/drop) component to display the Theme Switcher, providing a compact and convenient way to access theme options.

<Snippet version="2.1" component="theme_switcher.drop" />

## Modal

Alternatively, you can also display the Theme Switcher inside a [Modal](/docs/2.1/modal) component.

<Snippet version="2.1" component="theme_switcher.modal" />

## Internationalization

To customize language, you can now directly do it inside your markup. This allows for more flexibility and control over the text displayed to your users.

<Snippet version="2.1" component="theme_switcher.i18n" />
