## Usage

The Card component consists of the card itself, the card body and an optional card title. Typically, cards are arranged in grid columns.

| Class            | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.uk-card`       | Add this class to a `<div>` element to define the Card component.              |
| `.uk-card-body`  | Add this class to the card to create padding between the card and its content. |
| `.uk-card-title` | Add this class to a heading to define a card title.                            |

<Ec path="card.1" />

<Snippet component="card.basic" />

## Style modifiers

UIkit includes a number of modifiers that can be used to add a specific style to cards.

| Class                  | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-card-primary`     | Add this class to modify the card and emphasize it with a primary color.      |
| `.uk-card-secondary`   | Add this class to modify the card and give it a secondary background color.   |
| `.uk-card-destructive` | Add this class to modify the card and give it a destructive background color. |

## Header and footer

You can also divide a card into header and footer — around the default body. Just add the `.uk-card-header` or `.uk-card-footer` class to a `<div>` element inside the card.

<Snippet component="card.header_footer" />
